# CTF-Challenges

This repository contains code for old challenges for capture the flag problems.

Some code snippets may be useful; others may not be. Note that many of these challenges contain security issues: some of the issues are on purpose, others are unintentional. Digital Bond does not recommend using any challenges problems as source material for your own code.
